# why-sendable

Basic example showing why Sendable will be very nice when enforced in Swift 6. The `main` branch is an example of silently broken (in Swift 5.7) actor use. Check the `*-targeted` and `*-complete` targets to see the warnings telling you why it's broken. The `fixed` branch shows one possible fix for this very silly app.
